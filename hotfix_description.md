## Hotfix: Fix Mouse Interaction Issue

This hotfix resolves a critical issue where the `FlyingSanta` component was blocking mouse interactions across the entire application.

### Changes

- Added `style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}` explicitly to the `Canvas` component in `FlyingSanta.tsx`.
- This ensures that the canvas element generated by React Three Fiber does not capture pointer events, allowing clicks to pass through to the underlying UI.

### Verification

- Verified that the `FlyingSanta` component still renders correctly.
- Verified that buttons and links underneath the animation are now clickable.
