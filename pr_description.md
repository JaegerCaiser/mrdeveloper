## Description
Adds a festive 3D Flying Santa component to the application.

## Changes
- Created `FlyingSanta.tsx`: A procedural low-poly 3D Santa model built with React Three Fiber primitives.
- Implemented complex animation logic:
  - Santa flies across the screen from right to left.
  - Waves "Goodbye" with his right arm.
  - Bobbing and weaving flight path (sine wave motion).
  - Random appearance intervals (15-45 seconds).
- Integrated `FlyingSanta` into `App.tsx`.
- Cleaned up unused assets and dependencies.

## Visuals
Santa appears flying across the screen with a red and white low-poly design.
